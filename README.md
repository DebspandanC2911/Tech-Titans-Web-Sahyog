# Features

### Features for Dyslexia

#### Text Enhancement
The extension enhances readability for users with dyslexia by automatically emboldening the first two letters of each paragraph. This visual cue helps in distinguishing the beginning of new paragraphs, aiding comprehension and navigation through text-heavy web content.

#### Read Aloud Feature
Catering to varying reading abilities, the extension incorporates a powerful text-to-speech feature. Users can select any text on a webpage and have it read aloud in their preferred voice and at a comfortable speed. This functionality not only supports users with dyslexia by reducing reading fatigue but also enhances comprehension through auditory reinforcement.

### Features for Motor Impairments

#### Speech-to-Text Input
To mitigate the challenges associated with prolonged typing, especially for users with motor impairments, the extension integrates seamless speech-to-text functionality. This feature allows users to dictate text directly into text fields and forms on websites, eliminating the need for extensive manual input and promoting independence in digital communication.

# Achievements So Far
